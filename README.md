*Daxe* is an XML editor for the web. It works in the same way as [Jaxe](http://jaxe.sourceforge.net/en/), using an XML schema and a configuration file to define the XML language and the editor UI. A number of common element displays are provided with Daxe to make it easy to create a new editor UI for any XML language.

See the [Daxe website](http://adopt.github.io/daxe/) for more information.
